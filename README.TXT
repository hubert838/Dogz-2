Remember, each Petz II Adoption Kit comes with 
5 Petz breedz and a limited number of toyz.  You 
can only have one Petz out at a time in the Adoption 
Kits.  When you purchase the full version of Dogz II 
or Catz II, you'll be able to enjoy all the cool new 
features such as having two Petz out at once, (yes, 
Dogz and Catz can play together now), a whole 
collection of fun new toyz, and the ability to download 
new breedz and toyz from our Web site at:  www.petz.com

Please note:  When you install a Petz II product, 
Microsoft DirectX is also installed, but will not 
overwrite drivers you already have.  Once Installation 
is complete, restart your computer, then go to the 
folder called PF.Magic on your hard drive, and double-
click the file called "Petz II.exe" to launch and 
begin playing with your new Petz.

2.  Product Overview
Dogz II and Catz II are the newest releases in 
PF.Magic's best-selling line of Virtual Petz.  These 
products continue PF.Magic's mission to deliver the 
best virtual Petz experience in the world. In 
Dogz II and Catz II no two Petz are alike - every pet 
looks unique and has a unique personality.  Your 
virtual Petz are now even more intelligent and can 
play and interact with each other!  Also, more breedz 
of Petz and more toyz are available on the Web for 
users to download. 

Dogz II and Catz II are sold separately.  When both 
products are installed, Dogz and Catz can play with 
each other and with each other's toyz.

There are 3 separate areas in Dogz II:
     Playpen - This is the primary area.  Play 
with adopted Petz and toyz here.  (You can also let 
your Petz out of the Playpen into the Fullscreen 
Mode - here you can play with your Petz right on your 
desktop as you work in other applications or windows.)
     Adoption Center - Check out all the 
different breedz and adopt your Petz here.  Also, 
connect directly to the Online Adoption Center to 
see what new breedz are available to download.
     Toybox - Get new toyz and rearrange your Supply 
Shelf here.  Also, connect directly to the Online 
Toy Shop to download new toyz.
	
Owner's responsibility:  All Dogz that you adopt 
require daily attention.  Although you can adopt
as many Dogz as you like, you need to care for them 
properly.  If you neglect your Petz, they will 
run away.  Proper care for your Petz means playing 
with them, feeding them food and water, and giving 
them attention everyday that you launch Dogz II.

3.  Key Features in Dogz II:
	The most lifelike and warmest Virtual Petz.
	Multiple Character Interaction:
		2 Petz can be out at once and 
		play together  (Dogz-Dogz, and if
		you also own Catz II, Catz-Catz and   
		Dogz-Catz).  Interactions include: 
		Play w/ toyz together, chase, wrestle, 
		fight, square off or be friendly.   
	Adding New Content:
		Download new Breedz & Toyz from the Web:
		www.petz.com
 	Customizable Interface:
		Stock the Supply Shelf with your 
		favorite toyz - including multiple 
		copies of any toy.
	Improved look:
		Dogz are more expressive than ever 
		before and are true real-world breeds. 
	Adopt Multiple Petz:
		Adopt multiple Petz of the same breed, 
		all are unique, individual Petz.
		No two Dogz are exactly alike.
	Improved Training:
		Affect your Dogz' behavior with positive
		and negative reinforcement.  
	Screen Saver:
		Petz will show off in the Showcase mode.  
		The Slide Show mode presents all your 
		Petz photos.
	Import Old Petz - Backwards compatibility:
		Adopted Petz from Dogz 1.0 can be imported
		into Dogz II, so you don't have to abandon 
		your previously adopted Petz.
	Copy a Petz:
		Make a copy of your favorite Dogz and
		post them on the Web for others to play
		with or take your Petz to a friend's 
		computer to play.  (Your friend will need 
		to own Dogz II for this to work.)

4.  Tips & Fun Stuff
	PETTING:  
		Stroke your Petz with the cursor while 
		holding down the left mouse button to pet 
		them.
	PICK THEM UP: 
		Click and hold down the right mouse button 
		while over a Petz to pick it up and carry it.  
		Let go of the mouse button to drop your Petz.
	TRAIN YOUR PETZ:
		Gesture (wiggle a treat) in a direction to 
		see Petz do a trick in that direction. This 
		advanced degree of training is awesome.  
		Wiggle a treat over a toy to make Petz do a 
		trick with that toy - e.g. fetch it, balance 
		it on nose, jump on it.
	FEED YOUR PETZ:
		Dogz need to be fed food and water daily.
	PLAY WITH THEM:
		There is endless fun to be had with all the 
		toyz provided.
	TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEM:
		If you neglect or abuse your Petz, they will 
		run away.  Proper care for your Petz means 
		playing with them, feeding them food and water,
		and giving them attention every day that you 
		launch Dogz II.
	GAMES:
		Watch two dogz play "catch" with the ball.  
		See if you can get two Petz to play games with
		each other.  Throw the flying disc and watch
		your dogz catch it.  Adults are faster and can
		catch up more easily.   

5.  Troubleshooting:
** I AM GETTING A FILE NOT FOUND ERROR
- Make sure you have virtual memory turned on.  To do 
this, open System in your Control Panels and select the 
Performance tag.  Then, click on the Virtual Memory 
button at the bottom and choose "Let Windows manage my 
virtual memory settings."  
- Also, you need to make sure that the hard disk where 
your virtual memory swap disk is has at least 50 MB free.  
This is generally your C:/ drive.

** I GET AN ERROR INSTALLING PETZ II
- As with all setup programs, you should exit any open 
applications before running setup, including any other 
Petz programs.  Make sure you exit out of ALL open 
applications before installing Petz II.

** I HAVE A PROBLEM RUNNING SCANDISK AND PETZ II
AT THE SAME TIME
Due to the complexity of Petz II, and the large amount 
of unique animation and sound, Petz II will often prevent 
ScanDisk from running to completion.  This is due to 
signifigant amounts of swap activity in Windows virtual
memory.  If you experience trouble, we recommend you 
close Petz II before running ScanDisk.

If you run ScanDisk automatically, we suggest using the 
Slideshow Screen Saver.  Slideshow uses minimal system 
resources, and will allow ScanDisk to complete.

** MY MODEM REGISTRATION FAILS
- This is most likely due to an error in your modem setup.  
Try re-hooking up your modem.  You may also have trouble 
registering through LAN modem networks.  An easy solution 
to both of these problems is to print out your Petz II 
Registration card and Mail or Fax it to the address or 
number provided on the printout.  

** I AM HAVING PROBLEMS WITH INTERNET EXPLORER 4.0 
WHEN MY PETZ ARE IN FULLSCREEN
- There are incompatibilities between Internet Explorer 
4.0 and Petz II Active Background mode.  To fix this, 
disable Active Background mode by unchecking "Active 
Background Mode On" in the General Options menu under 
your Options Menu item.  You will still be able to go 
to Fullscreen mode, but you will not be able to access 
files underneath your Petz II program.

** ACTIVE BACKGROUND IS NOT WORKING, AND I AM NOT
USING INTERNET EXPLORER 4.0
- If you are experiencing problems in Active Background
Mode, such as not being able to pick up your Petz, you 
may be able to fix this by adding a line to your 
"Autoexec.bat" file.  To do this, go to the root level
of your C:\ drive and find "Autoexec.bat".  Right-click 
on "Autoexec.bat" and select "Edit" from the pull-down 
menu; this will open the file as an editable text file.
Add the following line to the bottom of the file: 

Path="The Path to your PetzII.exe file";%PATH%  

For example, if you have installed Petz II to its 
default directory, the line would read:  

Path="C:\Program Files\PF.Magic\Petz II";%PATH%  

Close "Autoexec.bat" and click "Yes" when prompted to 
save these changes.  You will need to restart your 
computer for these changes to take effect.

** I GET WINDOWS POP-UP MENUS WHEN I TRY TO 
CLICK ON THE SUPPLY SHELF
-In Petz II Active Background mode, Diamond InControl 
Tools' left-click or right-click popup menu may appear 
when clicking on the Supply Shelf.  To stop this from 
happening, go to Popup Menus under Display Properties 
and uncheck "Start Menu" under Left Mouse Button Popup 
Menu and/or "Enable Customized Popup Menu" under Right 
Mouse Button Popup Menu. 
-You can also choose to disable Petz II Active Background 
mode if you want to keep your customized InControl Tools' 
mouse options active. To do this, uncheck the "Active 
Background Mode On" option in your Petz II General 
Options menu.  Remember, if you disable the Active 
Background mode, you will no longer be able to work in 
your open windows while Petz II is running.  

** I'VE LOST MY PETZ II SCREEN SAVER PASSWORD
-If you forget your Petz II Screen Saver password while 
in the Screen Saver, you will need to restart your 
computer and enter a new password in your Display 
Properties/Screen Saver dialog. You can do this by 
launching Petz II, choosing "Screen Saver Options" from 
the Options menu and clicking on the Change button next 
to the "Password protected" option box.  Type in and 
confirm your new password and then click "Ok" to save 
your new password.

** MY SCREEN SAVER IS SET TO PETZ II EVEN THOUGH 
I DIDN'T CHOOSE IT IN THE DISPLAY PROPERTIES
-Selecting "Screen Saver Options" from the Petz II 
Options menu automatically switches any previously-
enabled non-Petz screen saver to the Petz II screen 
saver.  You will need to go back into your Screen 
Saver properties to choose a different screen saver.

** I'M EXPERIENCING STRANGE BEHAVIOR WITH MY 
PETZ OR THEIR TOYZ 
-Do not worry - your Petz probably just need a rest.  
Simply close the application re-launch it.  That is 
likely to cure many of the problems you may have.
-You can first try resetting your PF.Magic registry by 
holding down the Control key, Shift key and Home key at 
the same time that you launch Petz.  You will get a 
dialog asking if you want to reset the registry.  Click 
OK and your program will launch.                                      
-If Petz II continues to act up, you may want to try 
reinstalling your Petz II program.  To do this, first 
uninstall Petz II by opening the Add/Remove Programs 
Properties in your Control Panel at the root level of 
My Computer or under Settings in the Start Menu.  In 
the Install/Uninstall menu, select Petz II from the 
list and click on the "Add/Remove..." button.  Choose 
"Yes" in the "Confirm File Deletion" dialog.  NOTE:  
Uninstalling Petz II will NOT delete your Adopted 
Petz.  They will be waiting for you in their Playpen 
after you reinstall.  Reinstall Petz II by launching 
"Setup.exe" from your Petz II CD-ROM.

** NO SOUNDS ARE HEARD, OR THE SOUND IS NOT 
PLAYING PROPERLY
-Make sure the "Play Sound Effects" option is checked 
in the "General Options" menu and that you don't have 
"Play Sound Effects Only if Front Window" selected.  
If you're not hearing sounds in the Screen Saver, you 
may not have the "Petz II Sound Effects" option selected 
in your "Screen Saver Options" menu. 
-Petz will not make sounds when the Playpen is minimized 
(this is a quick way to quiet your Petz down!).  Make 
sure the Playpen is open on the screen or that you are 
in Fullscreen mode.
-You may have a problem with your DirectX sound drivers.  
Try reinstalling Petz II.  If this does not work, we 
suggest you try getting the most recent DirectX sound 
drivers directly from Microsoft by downloading it off 
their web site at:  www.microsoft.com/directx/default.asp  

** MY OTHER APPLICATIONS GET NO SOUND WHEN PETZ II
IS RUNNING; EVEN WHEN PETZ II SOUND IS TURNED OFF
-Sorry, Petz II needs to initialize the sound channel when 
launched, whether or not you have sounds on.  This means 
that Petz II needs to have constant access to the sound 
channel, therefore not allowing other applications to 
play sound.  You will still be able to play CD's in your 
CD-Rom drive, though.  Quit Petz II in order to hear
sounds in other applications.

** I GET A CRASH TRYING TO RUN PETZ II WITH 
ANOTHER APPLICATION
- Many older programs cannot run with newer programs 
that use Microsoft's DirectX.  Since Petz II uses 
DirectX's sound drivers, you may not be able to run 
Petz II at the same time as some of these older programs.

** THE GENERAL OPTIONS PULL-DOWN MENU TAKES 
A LONG TIME TO APPEAR
-If you had a network connection but no longer do, and 
have a link to the network in your Startup folder, you 
will experience long pauses in the Petz II program when 
you open the General Options Menu.  To fix this, either 
reconnect to the network, or delete your network link 
in "Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup." 

** I CANNOT "IMPORT" PETZ FROM A FOLDER THAT 
MY FRIEND COPIED FOR ME
-The import feature is only for importing Petz from 
Dogz I or Catz I.  It is not for bringing in Petz from
Petz II that friends copied for you or that you 
downloaded off of the internet.  In these cases, you 
need to copy your new Petz file into your "Adopted Petz" 
folder.

** I CAN'T STOP PLAYING WITH PETZ II
-That's OK.  Just be sure to play with all of the Petz
you have adopted equally, so that none feel left out.

** MY NON-VIRTUAL DOGS AND/OR CATS ARE GETTING JEALOUS 
WHEN I PLAY WITH PETZ II
-Don't forget to give your other pets love and affection,
food and water, and all the care that they need.  We know
that your other pets may also want to join in the fun
with Petz II, but we haven't gotten there yet.
